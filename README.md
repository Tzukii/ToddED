## Model
We used GPT2Neo. GPT2 is an auto completion model, so our users can input a title or topic starting with “In the TED Talk titled ___, the speaker says…”,. As a result, the model generates a Ted talk transcript the user is looking for. Or, the user can simply write a few words or the beginning of a sentence, and the model will autocomplete a paragraph in the style of a TED Talk.
